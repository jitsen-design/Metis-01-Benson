# Group Project at Metis Bootcamp

This resource pertains to my individual contribution to a group project at Metis. The project uses both MTA turnstile traffic information and the city's income distribution. The project goal was to optimize foot traffic and purchasing power in pinpointing subway entrance locations for the purpose of fundraising.
